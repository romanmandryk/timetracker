There is also a summary page which groups work by date and allows filtering.

Other features:
  - Filter work entries by date
  - Printer friendly - prints only what matters
  - Mobile friendly - app is responsive on smaller screens

Architecture
----

The app is built with MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js). 
The seed project was genereated with angular-fullstack yeoman generator which is a great starting point for ensuring best coding practices held on the project and for making production ready builds with one command.

Client side uses angular.js framework for data bindings, routing, and code modularization and twitter bootstrap for layout and additional components.

Server side runs with Node.js and Express framework which makes creation of REST endpoints very easy. MongoDB mappings are handled by Mongoose framework. User authentication is backed by Passport framework using local strategy
